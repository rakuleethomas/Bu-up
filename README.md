# Bu-up
Inspiration
We are living in a busy world. Often times, the owners of extremely busy restaurants might suddenly need more workers to cook or serve foods on a busy day. The owners of extremely busy nail salons often experience a short of the nail artists on a busy day. The workforce shortage is actually happening around us as a post Covid effect! Moreover, almost everyone, including myself, needs a side job to fulfill their financial needs, or even just to get some experience that they want to give it a try as a side income project. Bu-up mobile app will provide a solution instantly!

What it does
Bu-up (meaning "Side Job" in Korean language) will make connections between the employers who want to hire someone instantly and the job-seekers who want to get hired instantly for a day job.

How we built it
We started with brainstorming and rough sketches on a white board. Then we created Bu-up's general mobile layout and prototype design using Figma, utilized Kotlin program language to build up coding for Android, and AWS for the server data.

Challenges we ran into
We had a hard time customizing the data from the sever and utilizing with the Google Map. We finally linked our user data to visualize them on the Google Map. We are still working on customizing the user data for sending/receiving messages between users.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made this mobile app from scratch. Customizing the server data and visualizing them on where they need to be in the app is the biggest accomplishment.

What we learned
We've learn how to build a mobile app as a team. Our team is well balanced for checking and adapting each others' work, which made it possible to accelerate progress in a short period of time. Our team had a daily meeting to keep updating work with designing-coding-testing sequence.

What's next for Bu-up (Instantly Get Hired)
Our goal is to publish Bu-up mobile app by the end of 2021 :)
